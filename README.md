# 👋 Hi, I’m @branham-dev

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I’m a passionate software developer with a focus on **frontend development** using **React** and **Tailwind CSS**. While I’m more proficient on the frontend, I’m more enthusiastic about backend development, even though circumstances have led me to focus more on frontend technologies.
 I’m all about crafting applications that not only look great but also feel intuitive and effortless to use. My goal is to build tools that solve real problems, improve user experiences, and make a meaningful impact on how people interact with technology.
  

## 👀 I’m interested in...
- Web and mobile application development
- Creating seamless and responsive user interfaces
- Exploring new technologies, libraries, and frameworks
- Building products that simplify complex tasks

## 🌱 I’m currently learning...
- **Vue.js** for building dynamic user interfaces
- **GraphQL** for more efficient data fetching
- **TypeScript** to enhance my JavaScript skills and improve code quality
  
## 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on...
- Open-source projects in web development
- Design-focused projects, especially with **React** and **Tailwind**
- Freelance opportunities for frontend work

## ⚡ Fun fact:
I was homeschooled and taught myself web development through tons of independent learning, research, and experimentation. Independent learning has been a core part of my journey!
